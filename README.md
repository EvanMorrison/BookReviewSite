# Full Stack Book Review SPA

## [Visit the deployed project on Heroku](https://bookreviewspa.herokuapp.com)

This a full-stack pair programming project done while at V School. It is as exercise in team coding and project development, using Github, Trello, and implementing SCRUM and Agile practices.

The team consisted of myself and [Susan Sico] (https://github.com/susansico).


This is a full-stack SPA built with Angular, Node, and MongoDB, and also using Bootstrap, [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), and express server. The web app uses token authentication to store and track each user's personal book reviews, which can be created, edited and deleted.

The search view of the web app provides the ability to search for other books through the Google Book API, and add them to the database.
